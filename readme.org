       =TODO= Verify how is he getting the subspace inequalities by writing out
       the equivalence class relation.

       =Question=: While defining the factor space, he is using a single subspace
       W, but he is having many different -equivalence classes-. Shouldn't this
       be a single equivalence class? And the factor space will be a single
       equivalence class. If we have many subspaces, then we will have many
       equivalence classes, and a factor space makes sense.

       =Question=: How is the basis of the equivalence class different from W?
       It is confusing.

** DEM Force analysis
   This is implementation of DEM in 3d. We will do 8 test cases as given in
   Chung 2011 paper. The details of implementation are in [[~/phd/papers/dem_force_analysis/src/chung_tests/readme.md][readme file]]. The
   source code will be in the {pysph} folder. These 8 examples will be in the
   paper folder.

   1. Implement DEM particle particle with Hertz formulation.
   2. Implement DEM particle wall with Hertz formulation.

   Implement Chung paper.


** Chung Papers
   1. Test 1 (Done)
   2. Test 2 (Done)
   3. Test 3: Reading Anomalous energy dissipation in molecular dynamics
      simulation of grains by Luding. It has spring dashpot model (To understand
      two body modelling.). Then look at "On the Determination of the Damping
      Coefficient of Non-linear Spring-dashpot System to Model Hertz Contact for
      Simulation by Discrete Element Method" paper, and understand how the
      nonlinear damping is dealt.
